## Our Mission

**Making PHP development joyful again.**

After years of wrestling with heavyweight frameworks and rigid architectures, we believe PHP developers deserve better. PivotPHP isn't just a framework—it's a philosophy that code should evolve with your needs, not constrain them.

We're building an ecosystem where:
- **Performance comes first**, not as an afterthought
- **Flexibility is the default**, not a premium feature
- **Developer experience matters**, from first `composer require` to production deploy
- **Evolution is encouraged**, letting your code grow naturally

## Our Ecosystem

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Core Framework
**[pivotphp-core](https://github.com/pivotphp/pivotphp-core)**
The heart of PivotPHP. Fast, unopinionated microframework with Express.js-inspired syntax.

```php
$app = new Application();
$app->get('/hello/:name', fn($req, $res) =>
    $res->json(['message' => "Hello, {$req->params->name}!"])
);
$app->listen(8000);
```

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Database Integration
**[pivotphp-cycle-orm](https://github.com/pivotphp/pivotphp-cycle-orm)**
Zero-config database layer with Cycle ORM. High performance and type safety.

```php
DB::connect('mysql://user:pass@localhost/db');
$users = User::where('active', true)->get();
```

</td>
</tr>

### Official Website
**[website](https://github.com/pivotphp/website)**
Documentation, guides, and marketing site. Built with Jekyll for speed and simplicity.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Performance** | 13,374 requests/second |
| **PHP Version** | 8.1+ |
| **Memory Usage** | 0-2MB average |
| **Response Time** | 0.07ms average |

## Built for Modern PHP

```php
// Clean, expressive syntax
$app->group('/api/v1', function($group) {
    $group->middleware([Auth::jwt(), RateLimit::perMinute(100)]);

    $group->get('/profile', fn($req, $res) => $res->json($req->user));
    $group->resource('/posts', PostController::class);
});

// Type-safe validation
$data = $req->validate([
    'email' => 'required|email',
    'name' => 'required|string|max:100'
]);

// Zero-config WebSockets
$ws = new WebSocket\Server($app);
$ws->on('message', fn($socket, $data) => $socket->broadcast('update', $data));
```

## Getting Started

### For Developers
```bash
# Create your first PivotPHP app

### Performance First
Every line of code is optimized. We measure everything and make performance visible, because fast APIs make happy users.

### Developer Happiness
The best framework is the one you don't think about. PivotPHP stays out of your way while providing the tools you need.

### Community Driven
Built by developers, for developers. Every decision is made with real-world usage in mind, not academic ideals.

## About the Creator

**[Caio Alberto Fernandes](https://github.com/CAFernandes)** started PivotPHP after 6 years of frustration with existing PHP frameworks. What began as a weekend experiment to bring Express.js elegance to PHP has grown into a movement for better developer tools.

*"I believe the best frameworks are invisible—they amplify your skills without imposing their opinions. PivotPHP is my attempt to build that invisible layer for PHP developers."*
